Password Guessing
-----------------
We have recovered a shredded list of passwords from a nearby dumpster.
Despite our best efforts to piece it back together, it is still hard to make
out the passwords. Below are our best guesses for the passwords of each user -
perhaps with a bit of extra work you can work which are correct?

You will have a number of attempts to log in before the password is reset.
Using our cracked login program, you will be able to see how many characters
were correct - the right letter in the right position - for each attempt. You
should be able to work out the password using this information.

User     | Possible Passwords
---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------
root     | flask, great, asked, tarts, force, gleam, think, brick, flute,
         | brisk, freak, blast, feast, flick, flank

Image Password Guessing
-----------------------
Some organisations use images rather than text passwords in order to
authenticate users. For image login processes, each user specifies two sets of
images: A and B. The login screen presents the user with 4 images: 1 from
category A and 3 from category B. In order to log in, the user must select
the image from category A.

Our research has shown that users always pick images representing things that
they like for category A, and images representing their dislikes for category
B. We've used some social engineering techniques to identify the likes and
dislikes for several users - see if you can use this information to obtain
access.

User   | Likes          | Dislikes
-------|----------------|---------------------------------
User 1 | Soccer, Tennis | Cars, Planes, Flowers, Cats
User 2 | Flowers, Cats  | Cars, Planes, Dogs, Music
User 3 | Dogs, Cats     | Cars, Flowers, Computers, Food
User 4 | Dogs, Cats     | Cars, Planes, Fishing, Boats
User 5 | Cars, Food     | Fishing, Soccer, Computers, Cats


Cracking
--------
You'll sometimes need to use a hex editor to crack sprograms in order to
bypass security checks. The hex editor shows the code of the program
line-by-line.

Each line is made up of 6 numbers in hexadecimal format. In hexidecimal format,
the numbers from 10 to 16 are represented by the letters a to f. An '0x' prefix
indicates that numbers are in hexidecimal format. The table below shows the
mapping between hexidecimal and decimal numbers.

  Hexidecimal | Decimal
  ------------+--------
  0x0 - 0x9   | 0 - 9
  0xa         | 10
  0xb         | 11
  0xc         | 12
  0xd         | 13
  0xe         | 14
  0xf         | 15
  0x10        | 16
  0x11        | 17

In order to crack a program, you will need to modify the lines of code which
make up the program according to the following rules. The hex editor will
allow you to edit the lines of code one-by-one, replacing one value in the
line with another value. Follow the rules below in order to determine the
correct actions for each line:

(a) If this is the first line in the program go to (d), else go to (b)
(b) If this is the last line go to (j), else go to (c)
(c) If you made a change to the previous line, go to (g), else go to (d)
(d) If the line starts with a number less than 7, replace the number in the
    column given by that number with a 0, else go to (e)
(e) If the line contains one or more zeros (0x0), replace the first occurence
    with 15 (0xf), else go to (f)
(f) If the line contains more than 3 odd numbers, reduce the first odd number
    by 1, else go to (x)
(g) If the line ends with a number less than 0x7, replace the number in the
    column given by that number with the value that was replaced in the
    previous line, else go to (i)
(h) If the line contains one or more 15s (0xf), replace the first occurence
    with the number of the column in the last line which was edited, else go
    to (i)
(i) If the line contains one or more values which match the value inserted in
    the previous line, replace the first occurence with zero, else go to ()
(j) Replace the final value with the number of lines (excluding this line)
    which have been modified.
(x) Do not edit the line.


Security Chips
--------------
Some of our target devices have hardware security support in the form of
on-board expansion chips. These will prevent us from gaining access unless we
can somehow disable them. Luckily we were able to 'obtain' a copy of the
hardware specifications, which should help you bypass this protection.

Be careful - booting the system with an incorrect hardware configuration may
affect the system clock, which may reduce the amount of time you have before
you are logged out.

Each system may have one or more security chip on its motherboard, with an
associated pull-down resistor. In order to bypass the security system, you
must remove the chip, its pull-down resistor, or both, based on the information
in the following tables.

Table 1:
Use the last character of the security chip's identifier and the value of the
chip's pull-down resistor to determine the correction action.

         | Odd number  | Even number | Zero         | Letter
---------|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------
10 kOhms | N           | C           | R            | B
20 kOhms | C           | C           | B            | R
30 kOhms | R           | R           | C            | C
40 kOhms | B           | N           | R            | C
50 kOhms | T2, row 1   | T2, row 4   | N            | T2, row 3
60 kOhms | T2, row 5   | C           | T2, row 2    | T2, row 6

Key:
N: remove nothing.
C: remove the chip.
R: remove the resistor.
B: remove both.
T2, row #: Consult table 2, looking at the specified row.


Table 2:
Use the row given by table 1, and the first character of the terminal name to
determine the correct action.
         | Odd number  | Even number | Zero         | Letter
---------|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------
Row 1    | C           | N           | R            | C
Row 2    | R           | C           | R            | C
Row 3    | R           | B           | C            | R
Row 4    | C           | R           | C            | R
Row 5    | N           | C           | R            | B
Row 6    | C           | C           | C            | R

Key:
N: remove nothing.
C: remove the chip.
R: remove the resistor.
B: remove both.


Table 3:
This table shows the values of the different resistors, based on the coloured
markings (read from left to right) printed on the body of the resistor.
Markings               | Value
-----------------------|---------
red-red-yellow-green   | 10 kOhms
red-black-yellow-green | 20 kOhms
yellow-blue-blue-red   | 30 kOhms
red-blue-blue-yellow   | 40 kOhms
green-red-blue-green   | 50 kOhms
green-black-blue-green | 60 kOhms
