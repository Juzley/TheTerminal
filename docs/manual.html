<h1>The Terminal - Hacking Manual</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p> The terminal is a local multiplayer hacking game inspired by
<a href="http://keeptalkinggame.com">"Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes"</a>.
The aim of the game is to hack into a computer terminal by following the
instructions in the hacking manual, before the system locks you out.</p>

<p>Only one person can see and interact with the computer, but is not allowed
to view the hacking manual. The other players can view the manual, but are not
allowed to see the computer. The two groups must communicate with each other
in order to gain access before timer runs out.</p>

<h2>Game version</h2>

<p>It is important that the versions of your game and this manual match. The
game version is shown in the bottom right of the screen in the main menu. This
manual is for <em>version 0.1 (V0.1)</em> of the game.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>When you first start the a game, you will be presented with a terminal,
at which you can type commands. Different commands launch different programs
which you will need to use to gain access to the system - these programs may
be text-based, requiring keyboard input, or graphical, in which case you will
use the mouse.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the <span class=command>login</span> command is used to log in
to the terminal, and will prompt you for a password or similar form of
authentication. On some systems, you will find you cannot execute the login
command until other forms of security have been disabled - entering
<span class=command>login</span> will give you an idea of what further steps
are required.</p>

<p>The <span class=command>help</span> command lists the available commands on
each particular terminal - if you get stuck it is a good idea to try working
your way through this list. See the next section in this manual for
instructions for the different programs you will encounter.</p>

<p>If you wish to exit a program prematurely (i.e. without completing the
objective of the program), you may do so by pressing ctrl and c on your
keyboard - you can always run it again later.</p>

<h3 id=passwords>Guessing Passwords</h3>
<p class='intro'>We have recovered a shredded list of passwords from a nearby
dumpster. Despite our best efforts to piece it back together, it is still hard
to make out the passwords. Below are our best guesses for the passwords of each
user - perhaps with a bit of extra work you can work which are correct?</p>

<p>You will have a number of attempts to log in before the password is reset.
Using our cracked login program, you will be able to see how many characters
were correct - the right letter in the right position - for each attempt. You
should be able to work out the password using this information.</p>

<p>Inputting the incorrect password too many times will lead to a password
reset, and you'll have to start again.</p>

<h3 id='visualpasswords'>Guessing Visual Passwords</h3>
<p class='intro'>Some organisations use a visual password system. Users select
images to identify themselves, and this selection is then used for
authentication. Fortunately for us, people usually pick images based on the
things that they like...</p>

<p>The visual login process will present you with four images - three from the
user's selected images, and one which was not selected by the user. Use the
table below to identify the user based on the images you are presented with,
and select the three correct images</p>

<p>Selecting an incorrect image will result in a temporary lockout.</p>

<h3 id='cracking'>Cracking Programs</h3>
<p class='intro'>You'll sometimes need to modify the code of programs on the
computer you're attempting to gain access to in order to bypass security
checks. Brush off your programming skills and open your hex editor...</p>

<p>A program is made up of a number of lines of code, where each line consists
of 6 numbers. A hex editor will allow you to modify the lines of code
one-by-one, replacing one value in the line with another value. <em>Note
that in some cases, you will need to remember the value that you are replacing
for following lines.</em></p> 

<p>Follow the rules below in order to determine the correct actions for each
line. If you don't follow the instructions below carefully, the system will
detect your attempts to modify the program, and revert it to its original
state.</p>

<ol class=alternate type="a">
    <li>If this is the first line in the program go to (d), else go to (b)</li>
    <li>If this is the last line go to (j), else go to (c)</li>
    <li>If you made a change to the previous line, go to (g), else go to
        (d)</li>
    <li>If the line has one or more 9s, replace the last number in the line by
        7, else go to (e)</li>
    <li>If the line contains one or more zeros, replace the first occurence
        with 9, else go to (f)</li>
    <li>If the line contains more than 3 odd numbers, reduce the first odd
        number by 1, else go to (k)</li>
    <li>If the line has more than one zeros, replace the first number in the
        line with the number that was replaced in the previous line, else go
        to (h)</li>
    <li>If the line contains more than one 9s, replace the first occurence with
        the number of the column in the last line which was edited, else go to
        (i)</li>
    <li>If the line contains one or more values which match the value inserted
        in the previous line, replace the first occurence with zero, else go
        to (k)</li>
    <li>Replace the final value with the number of lines (excluding this line)
        which have been modified.</li>

<h3 id='decrypting'>Decrypting Filesystems</h3>
<p class='intro'>Some systems you encounter will have encrypted filesystems,
which will need to be unencrypted before you can progress further with a hack.
A disgruntled employee at one of the big security firms leaked some of the
encryption keys, which should allow you to progress</p>

<p>Our decryption program will present you with a section of encrypted data.
Use the table below to enter the correct plain-text data - decryption can then
take place based on this information.</p>

<p>Entering the incorrect key will cause data corruption, and recovering from
this will waste valuable time.</p>

<h3 id='hardware'>Disabling Hardware Security</h3>
<p class='intro'>Some of our target devices have hardware security support in
the form of on-board expansion chips. These will prevent us from gaining access 
unless we can somehow disable them. Luckily we were able to 'obtain' a copy of
the hardware specifications, which should help you bypass this protection.</p>

<p>Each system may have one or more security chip on its motherboard, with an
associated pull-down resistor. In order to bypass the security system, you
must remove the chip, its pull-down resistor, or both, based on the information
in the below tables. Removing a chip or resistor is achieved by simply
left-clicking on it.</p>

<img src='hardware.png' alt='Hardware diagram'>

<p>Once you have the correct hardware configuration, click the power button
to the bottom left of the screen to restart the computer. Booting the system
with an incorrect hardware configuration may affect the system clock, which may
reduce the amount of time you have before you are logged out.</p>

This table shows the values of the different resistors, based on the coloured
markings on the resistor.</p>

<h3 id='network'>Network Management</h3>
<p class='intro'>Some systems obtain login information from a remote
authentication server. The easiest way around this is to reconfigure the
network so that they are connected to one of our servers instead!</p>

<p>The network manager allows you to make network connections between devices
in a network. Each device is represented as a symbol in a grid. Your goal is
to use the arrow keys to draw a path from the computer you are attempting to
hack (the source, S) to our rogue authentication server (the destination, D).
You cannot visit a node in the network grid more than once.
</p>

<p>Some networks contain gateway switches (G). When connecting the source to
the destination, you must make sure to go through all such switches on the way.
Most networks also contain firewalls (x) - our server cannot communicate
through these devices and so they must be avoided.
</p>

<p>Attempts to configure the network such that it doesn't meet the above
requirements will fail, and the network configuration will roll back to its
previous state.</p>

<p>Below are some possible network configurations you will encounter. The
source and destination devices are identified by IP addresses, which are
included with the diagram.</p>

<h3 id='minehunt'>Minehunt</h3>
<p class=intro>The minehunt game is a poorly written Minesweeper clone,
installed on many of our target systems. The aim is to clear all the squares
not containing mines, without uncovering a mine. Flags can be placed to mark
known mine locations. Winning the game is not  your aim here, however: analysis
Minehunt's assembly code has revealed that it is possible to gain elavated
permissions if certain actions are performed in the right order</p>

<p>To trigger the exploit in the Minehunt game, follow the below steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use the mine count and size of board to determine which layout you
        have been presented with.</li>
    <li>Place flags (right click) on all but one of the mines, as indicated
        below.</li>
    <li>Detonate (left click) the final mine. With some board layouts, the time
        at which the final mine is detonated (whether the number of seconds in
        the counter is odd or even) is critical in triggering the exploit.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Below are all possible board layouts you may encounter.
Use the following key to determine which mines should be flagged, and which
should be detonated:
