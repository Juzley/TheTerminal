Security Chips
--------------
Some of our target devices have hardware security support in the form of
on-board expansion chips. These will prevent us from gaining access unless we
can somehow disable them. Luckily we were able to 'obtain' a copy of the
hardware specifications, which should help you bypass this protection.

Be careful - booting the system with an incorrect hardware configuration may
affect the system clock, which may reduce the amount of time you have before
you are logged out.

Each system may have one or more security chip on its motherboard, with an
associated pull-down resistor. In order to bypass the security system, you
must remove the chip, its pull-down resistor, or both, based on the information
in the following tables.

Table 1:
Use the last character of the security chip's identifier and the value of the
chip's pull-down resistor to determine the correction action.

         | Odd number  | Even number | Zero         | Letter
---------|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------
10 kOhms | N           | C           | R            | B
20 kOhms | C           | C           | B            | R
30 kOhms | R           | R           | C            | C
40 kOhms | B           | N           | R            | C
50 kOhms | T2, row 1   | T2, row 4   | N            | T2, row 3
60 kOhms | T2, row 5   | C           | T2, row 2    | T2, row 6

Key:
N: remove nothing.
C: remove the chip.
R: remove the resistor.
B: remove both.
T2, row #: Consult table 2, looking at the specified row.


Table 2:
Use the row given by table 1, and the first character of the terminal name to
determine the correct action.
         | Odd number  | Even number | Zero         | Letter
---------|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------
Row 1    | C           | N           | R            | C
Row 2    | R           | C           | R            | C
Row 3    | R           | B           | C            | R
Row 4    | C           | R           | C            | R
Row 5    | N           | C           | R            | B
Row 6    | C           | C           | C            | R

Key:
N: remove nothing.
C: remove the chip.
R: remove the resistor.
B: remove both.


Table 3:
This table shows the values of the different resistors, based on the coloured
markings (read from left to right) printed on the body of the resistor.
Markings               | Value
-----------------------|---------
red-red-yellow-green   | 10 kOhms
red-black-yellow-green | 20 kOhms
yellow-blue-blue-red   | 30 kOhms
red-blue-blue-yellow   | 40 kOhms
green-red-blue-green   | 50 kOhms
green-black-blue-green | 60 kOhms
