<h1>The Terminal</h1>



<h2>Overview</h2>

<p> The terminal is a local multiplayer hacking game inspired by
<a href="http://keeptalkinggame.com">"Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes"</a>.
The aim of the game is to hack into a computer terminal by following the
instructions in the hacking manual, before the system locks you out.</p>

<p>Only one person can see and interact with the computer, but is not allowed to
view the hacking manual. The other players can view the manual, but are not
allowed to see the computer. The two groups must communicate with each other
in order to gain access before timer runs out.</p>

<h3>Guessing Passwords</h3>
<p>We have recovered a shredded list of passwords from a nearby dumpster.
Despite our best efforts to piece it back together, it is still hard to make
out the passwords. Below are our best guesses for the passwords of each user -
perhaps with a bit of extra work you can work which are correct?</p>

<p>You will have a number of attempts to log in before the password is reset.
Using our cracked login program, you will be able to see how many characters
were correct - the right letter in the right position - for each attempt. You
should be able to work out the password using this information.</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>User</th><th>Possible Passwords</th></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>root</td>
        <td>flask, great, force, gleam, brick, flute, blast, feast, flick,
            flank</td>

<h3>Guessing Visual Passwords</h3>
<p>Some organisations use images rather than text passwords in order to
authenticate users. Each user selects a set of images to identify themselves.
The visual login process presents the user with three of these images, and one
other image - the user must select the other image in order to be granted
access. Selecting an incorrect image will result in a temporary lockout.</p>

<p>Most users select images that represent their likes and passtimes, which
allows the system to be easily bypassed with a bit of research. We've used some
social engineering techniques to identify the likes and dislikes for several
users - see if you can use this information to obtain access.</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>User</th><th>Likes</th></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>Cars, Cats, Dogs, Planes, Music, Flowers</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>Skateboarding, Horses, Music, Dogs, Food, Wine</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>Books, Computers, Cats, Archery, Boats, Cars</td>

<h3>Cracking Programs</h3>
<p>You'll sometimes need to use a hex editor to crack sprograms in order to
bypass security checks. The hex editor shows the code of the program
line-by-line. Each line is made up of 6 numbers.</p>

<p>In order to crack a program, you will need to modify the lines of code which
make up the program according to the following rules. The hex editor will
allow you to edit the lines of code one-by-one, replacing one value in the
line with another value. Follow the rules below in order to determine the
correct actions for each line:</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>If this is the first line in the program go to (d), else go to (b)</li>
    <li>If this is the last line go to (j), else go to (c)</li>
    <li>If you made a change to the previous line, go to (g), else go to
        (d)</li>
    <li>If the has one or more 9s, replace the last number in the line by 7,
        else go to (e)</li>
    <li>If the line contains one or more zeros, replace the first occurence
        with 9, else go to (f)</li>
    <li>If the line contains more than 3 odd numbers, reduce the first odd
        number by 1, else go to (x)</li>
    <li>If the line has one or more zeros, replace the first number in the
        line with the number that was replaced in the previous line, else go
        to (h)</li>
    <li>If the line contains one or more 9s, replace the first occurence with
        the number of the column in the last line which was edited, else go to
        (i)</li>
    <li>If the line contains one or more values which match the value inserted
        in the previous line, replace the first occurence with zero, else go
        to (x)</li>
    <li>Replace the final value with the number of lines (excluding this line)
        which have been modified.</li>
    <li>Do not edit the line.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Decrypting Filesystems</h3>
<p>Some systems you encounter will have encrypted filesystems, which will need
to be unencrypted before you can progress further with a hack.</p>
