# The Terminal

An entry into the Github 2016 Game-Off game jam, The Terminal is a cooperative hacking
game in the style of [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](http://keeptalkinggame.com).

The aim of the game is to hack into a computer terminal by following the
instructions in the hacking manual, before the system locks you out.

Only one player can see and interact with the computer, but is not allowed to
view the hacking manual. The other players can view the manual, but are not
allowed to see the computer. The two groups must communicate with each other
in order to gain access before timer runs out.
